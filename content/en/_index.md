# RHVoice

RHVoice is a free and open-source multilingual speech synthesizer.

Its developers hope to give more visually impaired people the ability
to use a good free synthesis voice reading in their native language
with their screen reader. We are especially interested in supporting
those languages for which there are currently no good voices that
could be used with a screen reader.

The creator of RHVoice, Olga Yakovleva, is blind herself. And many of
the contributors to the RHVoice project, both programmers and
non-programmers, are blind or partially sighted.

## Where can RHVoice be used?

* On Windows with NVDA and any SAPI 5 compatible program.
* On Android with TalkBack and other text-to-speech apps.
* On Linux with Orca.

See the [installation instructions]({{<relref "installation">}}) for
more details.
