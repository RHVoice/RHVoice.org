RHVoice 1.6.0 is now available.

## What's new

### Hana, an Albanian voice by LouderPages

Visit [LouderPages]({{<param "urls.lp.sq">}}), if you'd like to learn
about and install Hana.

### New voices by RHVoice Lab are now on Android

The latest voices created by the {{%rhvLabLink%}} team are now available in the Android
app too.

### An update of the Ukrainian dictionary

The community developed Ukranian pronunciation dictionary has been
updated. On Android the update will be installed automatically.
The latest Ukranian voice installers for Windows include the new dictionary.

### New emojis for most RHVoice languages

As new emojis get introduced, we add their names to our emoji
dictionaries. The Android app will install them automatically. They
are also included in the latest voice installers for Windows.

### Easier way to import user dictionaries on Android

If you use your own or third-party user dictionaries, you don't need
to copy them to a special directory any more, which may even be
impossible on Android 11 or later.

Open the RHVoice settings, select the language, and then tap "Add"
to import a user dictionary from a file on your device.

This method is supported on devices running Android 4.4 or later.

## Installation

### Windows

Visit the [installation]({{<relref "/installation#windows">}}) page
for the links to the latest installers.

### Android

If RHVoice is already installed on your device, it will be updated
automatically, if automatic updates are enabled. Or you can check for
updates manually.

As soon as the updated RHVoice runs again, it will try to download the
new language data. When the new data is downloaded, RHVoice will start
using it.

If you don't have RHVoice installed yet, the installation information
is [here]({{<relref "/installation#android">}})
