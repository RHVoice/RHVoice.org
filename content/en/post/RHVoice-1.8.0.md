RHVoice 1.8.0 is now available.

## What's new

### Polish language support

Polish voices and learn about the development team.

### New Macedonian voice

A new Macedonian voice, [Suze]({{<relref "../mk-voices#suze">}}), developed by {{%suzeDevLink%}}, is
now available for RHVoice.

### Android

A new language and voice data management system has been implemented. So from now on

  RHVoice is no longer available in the NVDA synthesizer selection dialog if there are no voices installed.
* [#446](https://github.com/RHVoice/RHVoice/pull/446), 
  Warn about the need to install voices.
* [#490](https://github.com/RHVoice/RHVoice/pull/490)
  Moved the rate boost setting to the conventional position.
* [#507](https://github.com/RHVoice/RHVoice/pull/507), ,
